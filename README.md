# Bayesian_block
Bayesian block decomposition for time series analysis.

Dynamic programming algorithm is used for solving
piecewise-constant and piecewise-linear models.
This is based on the algorith presented in Scargle
et al (2013).

One of the many applications is the identification 
of signal and background regions in gamma-ray burst data.
